# 📊 TASK-7-Get-Basic-Sales-Summary-from-a-Tiny-SQLite-Database-using-Python


### 🎯 Objective

Use SQL queries within Python to generate and visualize basic sales insights—like **total quantity sold** and **total revenue**—from a simple SQLite database.

---

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **Python**
* **SQLite** (via `sqlite3`)
* **Pandas** (for data handling)
* **Matplotlib** (for plotting)

---

### 💻 Platform Used: **Google Colab**

This project was created and executed entirely in **Google Colab**, which provides a cloud-based environment for running Python notebooks in the browser.

---

### 📂 Dataset

The dataset is programmatically created using sample sales data and stored in a local SQLite file named `sales_data.db`.

---

### 📌 Features Implemented

* Creates and populates a SQLite database
* SQL query to calculate:

  * Total quantity sold per product
  * Total revenue per product
* Displays a summary using `pandas`
* Plots a revenue bar chart with multiple colors
* Saves the chart as `sales_chart.png` (SHOWN IN REPOSITORY)

---

### 📈 Bar Chart Output

* X-axis: Product names
* Y-axis: Total revenue
* Output chart saved as: `sales_chart.png`

---

### 📦 File Structure (in Google Colab)

```
├── sales_data.db              # SQLite database (created in notebook)
├── sales_chart.png            # Output bar chart
└── Notebook.ipynb             # Your Colab notebook (save to Google Drive)
```

---

### ✅ Notes

* The dataset is automatically recreated every time the notebook is run.
* The project can be extended to include date filters, time-based trends, or multi-category analysis.
